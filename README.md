# GAMS Simulation Exercises Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains a series of exercises for two laboratory sessions (Lab1 and Lab2) designed to provide practical experience with the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). These exercises are aimed at simulating various mathematical optimization problems, ranging from basic to more complex scenarios. The purpose is to familiarize users with GAMS' capabilities in solving real-world problems through mathematical modeling.

## Lab1 Exercises
Lab1 focuses on introducing the fundamentals of GAMS modeling, with exercises designed to explore linear and non-linear programming techniques:
- **ejercicio1.gms**: Basic linear programming.
- **ejercicio2.gms**: Introduction to non-linear programming.
- **ejercicio3.gms**: Multi-variable optimization.

## Lab2 Exercises
Lab2 advances the complexity of the problems, providing exercises that require a deeper understanding of optimization methods and GAMS modeling:
- **ejercicio1.gms**: Complex optimization scenarios.
- **ejercicio2.gms**: Advanced non-linear programming techniques.
- **ejercicio3.gms**: Detailed multi-variable optimization problems.
- **ejercicio4.gms**: Sophisticated modeling exercises involving dynamic systems.
